# Learning_Machines
This is a repository for the Learning Machines project, and provides the code in the `src` folder to train a robot controllers to perform various tasks. The scripts allow robots to be trained in V-ENV using the course-provided materials, and the resulting controllers can be loaded for asynchronous real-time control.
