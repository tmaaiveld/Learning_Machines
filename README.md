# Learning_Machines
A repository for the Learning Machines project.

Welcome to Team Foxtrot's Github page.

Note: only add your own python scripts, don't push the entire /src folder - this causes some issues on windows as start-docker.bat manages a file called CMakeLists.txt which is specific to your installation of the robobo software. That way the git will only track what is necessary. You can still copy your /src entirely into the Learning_Machines folder and push as the files not tracked by git will not be pushed, but don't use `git add` on anything you didn't work on yourself.
