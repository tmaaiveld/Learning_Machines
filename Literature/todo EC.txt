ROBOT DRIVING PROJECT

OBSERVATIONS [slide]
- several observed patterns in simulation: 
- general
   > episode length strongly affects driving 
	in box sim, short lengths result in straighter driving

- # MUCH easier way to implement reeval:
mut = True

	select(pop) <- perform selection, 
		eval(pop) <- if mut apply fitness, if not mut calc reeval
	mut = True
	mutate(pop) <- pop has the fittest individual
		if mut:
			
		with p=0.2 set mut to False

can replace gene length with a constant IND_SIZE (or in params). makes it possible
to change the gene length. Could also drop model saving and just import from the csv
file, which has a history of all models.

- notes for the future
	- could do better at learning discipline and structure when coding...
	- could work more with dicts -> save all params in a big dict
	- spend more time moving stuff in functions when programming
